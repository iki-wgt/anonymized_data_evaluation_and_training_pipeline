# Pipeline for Systematic Training and Evaluation of YOLO on Anonymized Data

This repository provides a pipeline for anonymizing data & training and evaluating of YOLO object detection models on privacy-preserving data.

**Link to paper, graphs, and other visualizations will be provided at publication**

**Own dataset, along with further details, will be released upon publication**

**Repo is currently in a Work-in-Progress state in preparation for paper publication**

*Features:*

  - Face and full-body anonymization via DeepPrivacy2

  - YOLO training with flexible configuration

  - Evaluation using enhanced metrics (AP, mAP, F1/F2, SSIM) and MATLAB scripts for graphs
  
  - For easy use, single Dockerfiles for every module.
